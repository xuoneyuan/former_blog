## md5加密算法
### 简介
MD5 is a cryptographic hash function algorithm that takes the message as input of any length and changes it into a fixed-length message of 16 bytes. MD5 algorithm stands for the message-digest algorithm.The output of MD5 (Digest size) is always 128 bits. 

### md5特点
- Hash function
- Irreversibility

### md5加密原理
1. Padding data: The input data is padded to meet specific requirements, ensuring its length is a multiple of 512 bits. Padding involves appending a "1" bit to the end of the data and adding enough "0" bits to satisfy the condition of the length being congruent to 448 modulo 512.
2. Adding length information: The length of the padded data (in bits) is represented as a 64-bit binary number and appended to the end of the padded data.
3. Initializing variables: MD5 uses four 32-bit registers (A, B, C, D) as initial values for its internal state.
4. Group processing: The padded data is divided into several 512-bit blocks, and each block is processed individually.
5. Four-round loop compression: Each block undergoes a four-round loop compression operation. Each round consists of 16 steps involving bitwise operations (such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR), modulo operations, logical functions (such as AND, NOT, OR), and circular left shifts.
6. Outputting the result: The final output is obtained by adding the result of the last round to the initial values and concatenating them in a specific byte order to form a 128-bit hash value.
